# rpyjs

We all hate writing JavaScript.
What's even worse, though, is writing code that synchronizes backend and frontend objects so that you can have a good JavaScript UI for your crap.
RPyJS addresses the shocking lack of a remote object proxying framework for JavaScript by proxying JS objects to backend Python object, using promises for callbacks.
It's meant to be used from AngularJS.
